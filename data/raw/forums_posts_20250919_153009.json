    "content": "There’s a new AI model every few months, and AGI is always “right around the corner”. But what if AI never got better than it is today? Honestly, it wouldn’t matter. It’s already more than good enough. The problem isn’t the tech, it’s how we’re using it.\n\nIn a McKinsey 2025 survey, the single biggest driver of AI value wasn’t frontier models, it was redesigning workflows and embedding tools into real processes. Marketing and sales are already leading on adoption, but most firms haven’t rewired how work actually gets done. That’s why enterprise-wide gains are still lagging.\n\nSo yes, AI is already potent. The issue is us. We’re still clumsy with it.\n\nTake content creation. I’ve tested a hundred AI “content tools”. Most are terrible. I even built my own split-screen thing - brief on one side, sentence-by-sentence prompting on the other. Promising, but not there yet. Tools like Jasper? Definitely not it.\n\nAnd Agent platforms? The “I automated my lead-gen and now customers arrive on auto-pilot” stuff is fantasy. Anything starting with a ChatGPT style interface? I’m out.\n\nBut I’ve seen glimpses. There *is* something in agents, just not in the way it’s being sold today. We’re at the toddler stage.\n\nWhat we really need isn’t bigger models. We need sharper UI, better UX, and smarter workflows. That’s what will actually move the needle in marketing with AI. Until then, all the model hype is just noise.",

    "content": "The title pretty much. I'm an aspiring author as well as a stay at home father full time. Since my son was born, I had to place my writing on hold temporarily. Also, I am pretty creative. Not saying that I come up with unique ideas, just that I'm inherently creative. I try to get it out through writing, making board games, playing DnD, and even coding in Gamemaker. It helps get it out and lets me relax after. That being said, I have some scenes I come up in my head and would like to create a video of them (scenes from my book). I'm looking for an AI tool that can take a script that I write and turn it into a video (preferably long, like starting at 7 minutes and going longer if possible). It would also be nice if I can edit the script to change the scene and even if I can break the video up into multiple scenes (though not required). Some nice things would be generating voices and sound effects and syncing those voices to lips of characters. Also, having the characters stay true to their form throughout the video (I mean not changing their appearance). On top of this, if it can help code, that'd be great but also not what I'm looking for at the moment so if it can't that's okay. I also don't mind paying for it, though this is just for my own entertainment purposes and to show my wife. So while I'm okay with paying, I don't want to pay a lot. I'm looking more into the range of $20 per month if needed and would prefer to stay away from a credit system.\n\nI know these are a lot of stipulations, but I want to be up front with what I'm looking for. I did plenty of research looking into different models like VEO 3, Sora, and Descript, to name a few. But I want to know what others are using and their personal reviews on it to see what would work best in my situation.",

I’d start with ChatGPT to help you shape your script, refine dialogue, and even break down scenes to feed into video tools. For actually bringing the visuals to life, tools like Pika Labs or Runway are good for generating shorter clips, and Descript is handy for editing, adding voiceovers, and stitching everything together. Since it can be a bit of a learning curve, I’d also check out some AI video or storytelling courses on Coursiv, they’ll give you a solid starting point for getting the best results out of ChatGPT and other tools without spending hours guessing. That way you can bring your ideas to life and share them with your wife without spending a fortune. I hope this helps you and goodluck!",

    "content": "Our paper titled \"Analog Foundation Models\" from IBM Research and ETH Zurich just got accepted at NeurIPS, and I feel like the broader ML community is not aware of the potential Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) has, so I wanted to make a quick advertisement for the paper and the field as a whole.\n\nThe idea of using analog devices for computation in AI is pretty old, but never really took off because of many reasons such as scalability or complexity. However, recently, research labs from Stanford or IBM Research have demonstrated very simple and scalable Analog In-Memory Computing chips that have strong potential to harness the benefits of AIMC \\[1-3\\].\n\n**What's the problem with modern architectures such as GPUs?**  \nIn a conventional computer architecture, you have your memory and your processing unit separated by a bus, over which you send data back and forth. This is extremely power consuming especially in scenarios where you repeatedly need to access \\*a lot of data\\*. This is the case for LLMs: During inference, you need to constantly fetch the weights, KV cache, and activations from DRAM into your local SRAM-based caches, do the computation, and eventually write back the data to DRAM. This is really expensive in terms of power and latency.  \n  \n**Can't we get rid of DRAM (only use SRAM)?**  \nYes we can, and in fact there are some companies that are already doing that (e.g. Cerebras). The downside of this approach is that SRAM has very poor density (and does not scale anymore) and cannot hold billions of weights in a reasonable footprint (you need huge wafers, and many of them).\n\n**How about you just do the computation directly inside a very dense memory itself?**  \nThis is the idea of AIMC: We propose to take the matrix-vector multiplication operation (one of the most prominent ops in NNs) and execute it directly inside non-volatile memory using Ohm's law (multiplication) and Kirchhoff's current law (summation). When combined with a scalable 3D memory technology like 3D NAND Flash and a scalable model architecture like MoEs, this opens up completely new use-cases for AI because you will be able to serve 100B+ models on a single chip with a low power budget (10s of W)\\[4\\].\n\n**What's the catch?**  \nThere is always one...In the case of AIMC, it is the fact that computations are noisy and non-deterministic at runtime. In fact, up to now, no one was sure whether LLMs can be made robust to the noise present in AIMC-based hardware. Our paper \"Analog Foundation Models\" \\[5\\] changes this. We show that we can repeat the pre-training process of already pre-trained foundation models on synthetic data while using hardware-aware training methods to enhance the robustness of these LLMs.\n\nWe show that in terms of accuracy, we can now compete with 4-bit quantized LLMs!\n\nThis is a significant step towards making AIMC a reality and there is still a long way to go, but we're still super excited to have broken this barrier, which is why I wanted to introduce this to the broader ML community here!\n\nDo you want to get an intro to this topic? Then I suggest [this fundamental article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0655-z).\n\nDo you want to chat with me virtually or at NeurIPS? Just DM me!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04992-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04992-8)  \n\\[2\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06337-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06337-5)  \n\\[3\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01010-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01010-1)  \n\\[4\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00753-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00753-x)  \n\\[5\\] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09663](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09663)",

Maybe the community will find it useful.\n\nYou can think of mmore as something in the spirit of [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling), but designed from the ground up to run natively on multi-GPU and multi-node setups. As the backend OCR for PDFs (and images) we use [Surya](https://github.com/datalab-to/surya), which we’ve found to be both very accurate and fast. For those with limited GPU resources, we also provide a lightweight “fast” mode. It skips OCR (so it cannot process scanned files) but still works well for born-digital documents.\n\nIn a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11937) we released a few months ago, we showed that mmore achieves both speed and accuracy gains over Docling (maybe this has changed by now with the latest Granite-Docling). Right now, it supports a broad range of formats: PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, MD, EML (emails), TXT, HTML, as well as videos and audio (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, MP3, WAV, AAC).\n\nThe use cases are flexible. For example:\n\n* Unlocking text and image data from previously unprocessed files, enabling larger dataset creation (similar to what Docling + HuggingFace did a few days ago with [finepdfs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/finepdfs)).\n* Running text or multimodal RAG directly over your own document collections.\n\nWe are sharing this mainly to invite ideas and feedback from the community. If you see opportunities, have suggestions, or even just thoughts on directions we should explore, we’d love to hear them.

    "content": "Large Language Models shine at step-by-step reasoning in text, but struggle when tasks require visual changes. Existing methods often produce messy, incoherent results.\n\nWe introduce Uni-CoT, the first unified Chain-of-Thought framework that handles both image understanding + generation to enable coherent visual reasoning \\[as shown in Figure 1\\]. Our model even can supports NanoBanana–style geography reasoning \\[as shown in Figure 2\\]!\n\nSpecifically, we use **one unified architecture** (inspired by Bagel/Omni/Janus) to support multi-modal reasoning. This minimizes discrepancy between reasoning trajectories and visual state transitions, enabling coherent cross-modal reasoning. However, the multi-modal reasoning with unified model raise a large burden on computation and model training.\n\n# To solve it, we propose a hierarchical Macro–Micro CoT:\n\n* **Macro-Level CoT** → global planning, decomposing a task into subtasks.\n* **Micro-Level CoT** → executes subtasks as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, reducing token complexity and improving efficiency.\n\nThis **structured decomposition** shortens reasoning trajectories and lowers cognitive (and computational) load.\n\n# With this desigin, we build a novel training strategy for our Uni-CoT:\n\n* **Macro-level modeling**: refined on interleaved text–image sequences for global planning.\n* **Micro-level modeling**: auxiliary tasks (action generation, reward estimation, etc.) to guide efficient learning.\n* **Node-based reinforcement learning** to stabilize optimization across modalities.\n\n# Results:\n\n* Training efficiently only on **8 × A100 GPUs**\n* Inference efficiently only on 1 **× A100 GPU**\n* Achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on reasoning-driven benchmarks for image generation & editing.\n\n# Resource:\n\nOur paper：[https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606)\n\nGithub repo: [https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT](https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT)\n\nProject page: [https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/](https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/)",

I think you'd be okay to skip an ablation for now - you likely wouldn't have space to include it. Of course this is context dependent so I'd refer to your advisor/supervisor for expectations.",

For an 8 or longer pages paper it would be similar to the 4 pages ones but you can elaborate on the related work and method but that would still leave you with 3-4 pages for results which can include anywhere from 5 to 10 or more tables and figures covering different aspects of the proposed method.

Seeing people try it out and suggest improvements has been really motivating.\n\nThe most requested feature was multi file support. I added that now so you can point it to a folder and it will process everything inside extract the text run semantic search apply your schema or instructions and output a dataset.\n\nAnother request was running fully local with Ollama instead of relying on APIs. I will be adding that soon.\n\nStill early but it is working well so far. If you try it out and have ideas I would love to hear them.",

    "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI got just the game for this community. I want to share with you the latest[ Quantum Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2802710/Quantum_Odyssey/) update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post, to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.\n\nThe game has undergone a lot of improvements in terms of smoothing the learning curve and making sure it's completely bug free and crash free. Not long ago it used to be labelled as one of the most difficult puzzle games out there, hopefully that's no longer the case. (Ie. Check this review: [https://youtu.be/wz615FEmbL4?si=N8y9Rh-u-GXFVQDg](https://youtu.be/wz615FEmbL4?si=N8y9Rh-u-GXFVQDg) )\n\n**No background in math, physics or programming required**. Just your brain, your curiosity, and the drive to tinker, optimize, and unlock the logic that shapes reality. \n\nIt uses a **novel math-to-visuals framework** that turns all quantum equations into interactive puzzles. Your circuits are hardware-ready, mapping cleanly to real operations. This method is original to Quantum Odyssey and designed for true beginners and pros alike.\n\n# What You’ll Learn Through Play\n\n* **Boolean Logic** – bits, operators (NAND, OR, XOR, AND…), and classical arithmetic (adders). Learn how these can combine to build anything classical. You will learn to port these to a quantum computer.\n* **Quantum Logic** – qubits, the math behind them (linear algebra, SU(2), complex numbers), all Turing-complete gates (beyond Clifford set), and make tensors to evolve systems. Freely combine or create your own gates to build anything you can imagine using polar or complex numbers.\n* **Quantum Phenomena** – storing and retrieving information in the X, Y, Z bases; superposition (pure and mixed states), interference, entanglement, the no-cloning rule, reversibility, and how the measurement basis changes what you see.\n* **Core Quantum Tricks** – phase kickback, amplitude amplification, storing information in phase and retrieving it through interference, build custom gates and tensors, and define any entanglement scenario. (Control logic is handled separately from other gates.)\n* **Famous Quantum Algorithms** – explore Deutsch–Jozsa, Grover’s search, quantum Fourier transforms, Bernstein–Vazirani, and more.\n* **Build & See Quantum Algorithms in Action** – instead of just writing/ reading equations, make & watch algorithms unfold step by step so they become clear, visual, and unforgettable. Quantum Odyssey is built to grow into a full universal quantum computing learning platform. If a universal quantum computer can do it, we aim to bring it into the game, so your quantum journey never ends.",

The challenge: handling wildly different dataset schemas and descriptions.\n   * We experimented with \\[X approach vs Y approach\\], and here’s what worked best for relevance scoring.\n2. **Making datasets discoverable by LLMs**\n   * Our goal was to have datasets show up when someone prompts ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.\n   * This required structuring metadata so that LLMs can parse/use it, without bloating storage or slowing retrieval.\n3. **Simplifying onboarding for data providers**\n   * Most data marketplaces are complex; we cut onboarding down to 3 steps.\n   * The challenge: validating data quality at scale without manual review.\n\nWould love to hear from this community:\n\n* How would you approach semantic dataset search differently?\n* Are there pitfalls we haven’t thought about in exposing data to LLMs?\n* What would you consider the “hardest part” of scaling this to millions of datasets?",

        "body": "Conceptually the problem lies in whether you're dealing with a distributed system and who controls the individual bits and pieces. \n\nRDBMSes have been built to cater to individual apps integrating through the database, so in that paradigm you'll end up putting a lot of shared logic into the database because there's really no good way around it. Note that, however, each application is trusted and at some point the DB becomes an integration point that cannot be subject to splitting and parallelization, so you have to have those things in place somehow before you commence development. This involves setting up the schema and things like stored procedures to abstract out certain operations, so you don't end up with a dozen slightly different interpretations of the same thing.\n\nHowever, plenty of apps just don't need that and their development can be centralized. In that case the RDBMS is more of a simple data store. It can even be replaced with an embedded database or multiple embedded databases plus application-level coordination. You have a single monolith and it's definitely possible and desirable to avoid the impedance mismatch and code everything in the application.\n\nThere's also the option to have multiple services that call each other. However the tricky bit there is doing stuff like cross-service queries and transactions, if you end up needing those. And, really, you often do unless you're dealing with totally separate things that stand on their own.\n\nAnyway, so far this mostly touches upon data access without regard for permissions. There are multiple ways to see permissions. One is as coordinated cross-service logic which ensures consistency and prevents mistakes, e.g. some service won't end up allowing data access where it shouldn't. This is an extension of what I said above. Another is dealing with totally untrusted 3rd parties, but this typically tends to be out of scope for RDBMSes (you don't open up your PostgreSQL to the world).\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is it's more important that the choice of how you do it is consistent with how you develop things. If you end up outsourcing building three components to three different vendors and they *somehow* have to arrive at the same permissions logic, that's clearly going to be a pain point. But aside from potential consequences, this really isn't very different from other bits of shared logic. Which you need to centralize somewhere at some level.",

There are wins here IMO, especially with the upcoming OAuth support in Postgres 18, as you'll be able to have an external service like keycloak managing authentication for both the database and the front end, with all the permissions defined in the database.  Good good.\n\nBut having individual database accounts stops you from using effective connection pooling.  Now, half the people reading this are thinking, \"Yep, that's a complete killer.  Don't even bother thinking about it.\"  The other half are thinking, \"So what?\"  They're each aware that the other exists and both think the others are idiots.  But they both have a point.\n\nSee, the first type write web applications which typically have many users and short interactions.  New users arrive all the time, do a couple of things, then disappear and are replaced by a new user.  Connection pooling is a big win for them.\n\nThe other type write enterprise applications where one person logs in at the start of the day and sits there for hours on end entering and looking up data.  For them, giving each user a database connection that stays open all day probably isn't that big a deal and is justified by the other benefits.  Postgres, with its one-connection-per-postmaster-process model, is kind of the worst possible case for this, but it's still not the end of the world if your application has dozens to hundreds of users.",

Supposedly it has all these edge cases which can bite you, but I'd never know -- the non-edge cases bite me way before I can get to those. I hate yaml so much. \n\nRegarding KSON, there's a lot of great stuff there:\n\n* Comments! I want to smack everyone who says that json shouldn't have comments because it's just for transport. No. Just no. Its history and original intent do not matter to me in the slightest. It is a configuration format and ought to have the option for human readable comments (and forgiveness of trailing commas).\n* Your embedded block appears to support new lines with actual new lines instead of metacharacters. This is another pain-point in json that I would love to see fixed\n* Easy to read yaml-like trees. The only thing yaml has going for it in my experience is this format. It's so much easier on the eyes\n* Java and javascript support. It's impossible to overstate the importance of lowering the barrier to entry for things like this. That said, it needs python and C# if you want it to be considered for the rest of us\n* json superset. Another 'lowering the barrier to entry' piece of magic. Telling me that 100% of my old config files still work is wonderful\n\nThere's also some bad things:\n\n* Allowing strings without requiring single or dbl-quotes is eventually going to get you right back into yaml nightmare territory. false != \"false\", 0 != \"0\", 0.0 != \"0.0\". Maybe this won't matter to the pythons and luas out there, but to strongly typed c#/.net folks, this matters\n* Code blocks. If you ever put code in my config files, we're gunna fight. There's so much possibility for bad here. Turing complete opens up a can of worms, not the least of which is unexpected runtime or memory use when you're just trying to use your config file\n* `'(1 + √.5)/2'` is not a number, it's a calculation. See above\n* Not sure how I feel about `π` as a number. I'm inclined against it because there's no way to know how it will interact with your language of choice until trial and error.

I'm on a team with three other DS (two statisticians and one computer scientist) at a third-party engineering and technology company that provides services to a sanitation company in the Federal District.\n\nWe work based on project plans provided by the client, which involve various types of projects, but it's an environment without methodology (it's a new department), the company's data is poor, there is no data engineering structure, a lot of idle time, and the projects are sometimes simple (last month I built a BI project by myself while the team did nothing) or impractical for data scientists (we've already done a web deployment of automated reports, and only myself and another employee who knew development from his CS degree handled the task). They literally pass on any project they think we can handle, and I get the feeling that I might be wasting my time here.\n\nI have advanced English (I'd like to develop my fluency), and my brother is working at a tech company in Lisbon, Portugal; he would be my bridge to the international market.

It's not that I can't handle it, but I'm thinking about it for my own sanity).\n\nAm I being too anxious, or is jumping into the European market with little experience a valid approach?

I think for most people it can be a fairly big leap. How much of a leap it is depends on how good you are at software engineering as ML engineering can be considered a specialized form of backend engineering.\n\n>  I’m planning to start practicing LeetCode, but am I VERY (months/a year) behind because i dont know DS&A theory or will I instead be able to pick up everything quickly by practicing?\n\nThere's some stuff you probably won't learn from just grinding leetcode. I think learning complexity analysis and theory from reading leetcode solutions or comments would only give you a surface level understanding, but maybe that's enough for you.",

I'm happy to sit in awkward silence, hang up, or stop replying to them if they insist that I give the number first. I'm not giving up a huge amount of my negotiating power for free. If they try to tell me that they don't have a range established, they're either lying or are not serious about hiring. In either case, I'm not interested.

Essentially they only do this to try to lowball you.\n\nI recently had a recruiter reach out where the range was (what I make now) to (what I make now + 30k). I said that the only way that I would be interested in interviewing was if we all understood that I was interviewing for the top of the range.

Instead of fiddling with prompts that sometimes regress, you just build up examples. Each example improves accuracy in a concrete way, and you often need far fewer than traditional ML approaches.\n\n\n\nHow it works (prototype is live):\n\n\\- Upload a document (DOCX, PDF, image, etc.)\n\n\\- Select and tag parts of it (supports nesting, arrays, custom tag structures)\n\n\\- Upload another document → click \"predict\" → see editable annotations\n\n\\- Amend them and save as another example\n\n\\- Call the API with a third document → get JSON back\n\n\n\nPotential use cases:\n\n\\- Identify important clauses in contracts\n\n\\- Extract total value from invoices\n\n\\- Subjective tags like “healthy ingredients” on a label\n\n\\- Objective tags like “postcode” or “phone number”\n\nIt seems to generalize well: you can even tag things like “good rhymes” in a poem. Basically anything an LLM can comprehend and extrapolate.\n\n\n\nI’d love feedback on:\n\n\\- Does this kind of few-shot / K-shot approach seem useful in practice?\n\n\\- Are there other document-processing scenarios where this would be particularly impactful?\n\n\\- Pitfalls you’d anticipate?\n\n  \nI've called this \"DeepTagger\", first link on google if you search that, if you want to try it!

I'm not looking for help in anyway, just hope this might helpful to someone looking for a role in this area. I know a lot of people are against take home assignments, I get it, but the reality is many employers still use them.\n\nI'll try to format things as best as possible, but it's tough when you can't post attachments.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nEmployer uses machine learning models to evaluate borrower risk and determine loan eligibility. In July 2024, we launched **Model B** to replace **Model A**, aiming to improve loan approvals and portfolio returns. Our executive team has expressed concern that Model B might be underperforming in some cases.\n\nYour task is to assess the performance of Models A and B across these loan product types and answer the central question: **Should we roll back to Model A or keep and improve Model B?** Additionally, analyze the dataset to uncover any other insights that could guide our decision-making and optimize our lending strategy.\n\nPlease put together a presentation summarizing your findings, insights, and recommendations. Assume your audience has a low level of familiarity with the specifics of the problem but will appreciate clear, data-driven reasoning and business implications. You will present your findings in a 45 minute meeting with stakeholders but ensure to leave ample time for their questions.\n\n**Data Dictionary (for the two attachments below):**\n\n* *Origination Month:* Month in which the loan was funded.\n* *Payment Month:* Payments are made monthly.

original model and Model\\_B is the new, updated model.\n* *Scheduled Loan Repayment:* The loan repayments as determined by the amortization schedule at origination.\n* *Forecasted Loan Repayment:* The loan repayments that are forecasted by each model at origination.\n* *Actual Loan Repayment:* The actual loan repayments made during each payment month by borrowers.\n* *Application Submits:* Loan applications that are submitted.\n* *Origination Amount:* The initial principal amount when the loan is funded.\n* *Note: Employer earns revenue as a % fee of the loan origination amount and the

For those preparing for similar assessments, I'd add that demonstrating your thought process is often more valuable than perfect code.

Consider adding a section on model interpretability - in finance, being able to explain why a model made a specific decision is often as important as accuracy.

I'd appreciate a sanity check on my approach and any advice you might have.\n\n**My Goal**: Quantify how much our marketing spend contributes to advertiser acquisition and overall ad revenue.\n\n**The Challenge**: I don't believe there's a direct causal link. My hypothesis is a two-stage process:\n\n* Stage 1:  Marketing spend -> Increases user acquisition and retention -> Leads to higher Monthly Active Users (MAUs).\n* Stage 2: Higher MAUs -> Makes our platform more attractive to advertisers -> Leads to more advertisers and higher ad revenue.\n\nThe problem is that the variable in the middle (MAUs) is endogenous. A simple regression of Ad Revenue \\~ MAUs would be biased because unobserved factors (e.g., seasonality, product improvements, economic trends) likely influence both user activity and advertiser spend simultaneously.\n\n**Proposed IV Setup**:\n\n* **Outcome Variable** (Y): Advertiser Revenue.\n* **Endogenous Explanatory Variable** (\"Treatment\") (X): MAUs (or another user volume/engagement metric).\n* **Instrumental Variable** (Z): This is where I'm stuck. I need a variable that influences MAUs but does not directly affect advertiser revenue, which I believe should be marketing spend. \n\nMy Questions:\n\n* Is this the right way to conceptualize the problem? Is IV the correct tool for this kind of mediated relationship where the mediator (user volume) is endogenous? Is there a different tool that I could use?\n* This brings me to a more fundamental question: Does this setup require a formal \"experiment\"? Or can I apply this IV design to historical, observational time-series data to untangle these effects?\n\nThanks for any insights!\n\n",

You buy ads in time t which are shown to people who then get on your platform and increase your MAUs for time t+1, t+2, t+3, etc. This is then observed by other businesses who choose to buy more ads on your platform at time t+2. However, you're still buying ads during time t+1, t+2, and so on. I think this is a case where you'd be better off proving Part 1 and Part 2 separately because trying to go straight from higher ad spend -> more ad revenue has what I would guess are long and variable lags\n\nEdit: saw your comment below where you said that you solved Part 1 already. Okay then. I think that you may still have a lag problem going from higher MAUs to higher ad spend (Are all your advertisers doing ad buys in real time or even every month? Somehow I doubt it). Another issue is that advertisers are choosing between a number of different platforms to place ads. Anything that increases your MAUs that also increases the MAUs of all your other competitors won't have an effect, so you shouldn't use a sectoral variable as your instrument. It's hard to say without knowing exactly what your business is.",

There's just too much you can't control for to reliably believe you've found an appropriate (yet sufficiently strong) instrument. Plus even if you have you're estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect, not the Average Treatment Effect. \n\nGenerally your question is just very difficult to answer. As you'd expect for a platform the users and advertisers are very intimately linked. Depending on your data some things I'd consider:\n\n- Do you guys do staggered roll-outs for product feature? If you think these improve user acquisition you can try using the presence of the feature as an instrument, though of course I'm sure these aren't rolled out randomly\n- Depending on your data size you can explore panel data fixed effects methods. Run a regression of the difference in spend per advertiser in a certain region over the difference in user growth for a region. Add a bunch of fixed effects (region, year, seasonal, sector, etc.) and as many controls as you can\n- Leverage other research to answer your question. There's a huge literature on Network Economics.

In contrast, Gaussian Copula provided reasonably strong privacy and far better fidelity.\n\nFor example, Okun’s law (the relationship between GDP and unemployment) still held in the Gaussian Copula data, which makes sense since it models the underlying distributions. What surprised me was how poorly CTGAN performed analytically... in one regression, the coefficients even flipped signs for both independent variables.\n\nHas anyone here used synthetic data for research or production modeling in finance?

Both methods rely on the continuation of past statistical relationships and distributions into the present but this is a dangerous assumption with macroeconomic data. This is because macroeconomic data is influenced by people who can also see these past relationships (typically central banks). \n\nConsider the relationship between inflation and unemployment (the so-called Phillips Curve). In the past (the 1950s-1960s) it was assumed that these variables had a relatively fixed relationship. Inflation goes up, unemployment goes down. Inflation goes down, unemployment goes up. Therefore, it was widely believed by economists that you could decrease unemployment by increasing inflation. So economists tried that and it didn't work. The Phillips Curve broke and there was both high inflation and high unemployment at the same time. The problem was that the Phillips Curve's validity was reliant upon the decisions made by policymakers *before* they knew the Phillips Curve existed. Once they gained new \"knowledge\" of the economy, they changed how they made their decisions which in turn changed the underlying relationship. \n\nThis is known in economics as the Lucas Critique. Basically, not only are these variables not statistically independent but their statistical dependence is not fixed.",

        "body": "First, let me commend you for actively pursuing better solutions in a space that you may not fully understand. This embodies the spirit of what it meant to do data science when the field started. That said, I think this post is riddled with misconceptions that make it difficult to follow, but let me try my best to provide some productive dialogue. \n\nWhat you are describing is not a database, but rather file or object storage. The data is also not tree structured, it is unstructured. The directory structure itself is also not technically tree structured because projects can share studies, whereas tree branches do not share leaves. \n\nSo if I am understanding this right, you have something like SharePoint, Google drive, Dropbox, or other network drive that you would like to search through using a tool or programming library. In this case, searches do not traditionally parse through the files themselves, but rather metadata on the files/folders that you must create and maintain, like creating a catalog or tagging all of your data. Since your studies are shared by projects and there are not many categories, you might consider abandoning the hierarchy (you call tree) altogether and just have studies all in one flat directory but tag each study with a project, category, and related studies. \n\nIf you really care about the relationships of the studies and projects, you can create a small graph database to link the studies, and you can do complex searches, such as \"how many studies do I have that have at least 2 child studies\". But to be clear, this is just a metadata layer on top of your folder structure and not looking at the data files you've stored. \n\nI said above that search does not traditionally parse through files but modern platforms and LLM-based approaches do. This is relatively new, not yet very reliable, and not something an individual can really implement in a meaningful way. The big platforms like SharePoint and Google drive are all moving this way and will probably soon have advanced capabilities to do what you are describing. \n\nLastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention that scripts, data frames, and pptx all living in one directory is generally bad practice unless you are zipping away for archive. \n\nHope this is helpful",

    "content": "**The “three tiers” of data engineering pay — and how to move up (shout out to the article by geergly orosz which i placed in the bottom)**\n\nI keep seeing folks compare salaries across wildly different companies and walk away confused. A useful mental model I’ve found is that comp clusters into *three tiers* based on company type, not just your years of experience or title. Sharing this to help people calibrate expectations and plan the next move.\n\n# The three tiers\n\n* **Tier 1 — “Engineering is a cost center.”** Think traditional companies, smaller startups, internal IT/BI, or teams where data is a support function. Pay is the most modest, equity/bonuses are limited, scope is narrower, and work is predictable (reports, ELT to a warehouse, a few Airflow dags, light stakeholder churn).\n* **Tier 2 — “Data is a growth lever.”** Funded startups/scaleups and product-centric companies. You’ll see modern stacks (cloud warehouses/lakehouses, dbt, orchestration, event pipelines), clearer paths to impact, and some equity/bonus. companies expect design thinking and hands-on depth. Faster pace, more ambiguity, bigger upside.\n* **Tier 3 — “Data is a moat.”** Big tech, trading/quant, high-scale platforms, and companies competing globally for talent. Total comp can be multiples of Tier 1. hiring process are rigorous (coding + system design + domain depth). Expectations are high: reliability SLAs, cost controls at scale, privacy/compliance, streaming/near-real-time systems, complex data contracts.\n\nNone of these are “better” by default. They’re just different trade-offs: stability vs. upside, predictability vs. scope, lower stress vs. higher growth.\n\n# Signals you’re looking at each tier\n\n* **Tier 1:** job reqs emphasize tools (“Airflow, SQL, Tableau”) over outcomes; little talk of SLAs, lineage, or contracts; analytics asks dominate; compensation is mainly base.\n* **Tier 2:** talks about metrics that move the business, experimentation, ownership of domains, real data quality/process governance; base + some bonus/equity; leveling exists but is fuzzy.\n* **Tier 3:** explicit levels/bands, RSUs or meaningful options, on-call for data infra, strong SRE practices, platform/mesh/contract language, cost/perf trade-offs are daily work.\n\n# If you want to climb a tier, focus on evidence of impact at scale\n\nThis is what consistently changes comp conversations:\n\n* **Design → not just build.** Bring written designs for one or two systems you led: ingestion → storage → transformation → serving. Show choices and trade-offs (batch vs streaming, files vs tables, CDC vs snapshots, cost vs latency).\n* **Reliability & correctness.** Prove you’ve owned SLAs/SLOs, data tests, contracts, backfills, schema evolution, and incident reviews. Screenshots aren’t necessary—bullet the incident, root cause, blast radius, and the guardrail you added.\n* **Cost awareness.** Know your unit economics (e.g., cost per 1M events, per TB transformed, per dashboard refresh). If you’ve saved the company money, quantify it.\n* **Breadth across the stack.** A credible story across ingestion (Kafka/Kinesis/CDC), processing (Spark/Flink/dbt), orchestration (Airflow/Argo), storage (lakehouse/warehouse), and serving (feature store, semantic layer, APIs). You don’t need to be an expert in all—show you can choose appropriately.\n* **Observability.** Lineage, data quality checks, freshness alerts, SLIs tied to downstream consumers.\n* **Security & compliance.** RBAC, PII handling, row/column-level security, audit trails. Even basic exposure here is a differentiator.\n\n# prep that actually moves the needle\n\n* **Coding:** you don’t need to win ICPC, but you *do* need to write clean Python/SQL under time pressure and reason about complexity.\n* **Data system design:** practice 45–60 min sessions. Design an events pipeline, CDC into a lakehouse, or a real-time metrics system. Cover partitioning, backfills, late data, idempotency, dedupe, compaction, schema evolution, and cost.\n* **Storytelling with numbers:** have 3–4 impact bullets with metrics: “Reduced warehouse spend 28% by switching X to partitioned Parquet + object pruning,” “Cut pipeline latency from 2h → 15m by moving Y to streaming with windowed joins,” etc.\n* **Negotiation prep:** know base/bonus/equity ranges for the level (bands differ by tier). Understand RSUs vs options, vesting, cliffs, refreshers, and how performance ties to bonus.\n\n# Common traps that keep people stuck\n\n* **Tool-first resumes.** Listing ten tools without outcomes reads Tier 1. Frame with “problem → action → measurable result.”\n* **Only dashboards.** Valuable, but hiring loops for higher tiers want ownership of data *as a product*.\n* **Ignoring reliability.** If you’ve never run an incident call for data, you’re missing a lever that Tier 2/3 value highly.\n* **No cost story.** At scale, cost is a feature. Even a small POC that trims spend is compelling signal.\n\n# Why this matters\n\nAverages hide the spread. Two data engineers with the same YOE can be multiple tiers apart in pay purely based on company type and scope. When you calibrate to tiers, expectations and strategy get clearer.\n\nIf you want a deeper read on the broader “three clusters” concept for software salaries, Gergely Orosz has a solid breakdown (“The Trimodal Nature of Software Engineering Salaries”).

        "body": "It's worth noting that Nexstar, the company which owns the most TV stations in the US (incl 32 ABC stations) has an upcoming merger with a major competitor Tegna that will require regulatory approval from the FCC. They were the first to cancel Kimmel. I'm not sure if this is covered in the linked article OP posted (paywalled) but the FCC chairman recently made comments implying if Kimmel isn't cancelled, the merger will have problems. So yes, definitely government censorship mixed alongside the usual corporate corruption \n\nSee this article https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-live-canceled.html \n\n \n>What is Nexstar and who leads the company?\n\n>A company with a recent history of right-wing-campaign contributions, Nexstar currently owns 197 television stations across the U.S., more than competitors such as Sinclair, Scripps, and Hearst. A merger with Tribune Media in 2019 made Nexstar the largest TV-station owner in the country.(...)\n\n>And it wants to get even bigger: Founder and CEO Perry A. Sook has expressed an eagerness to make deals under the Trump administration. “We believe that there is value to be created for our shareholders through further consolidation,” he said on his earnings call immediately following the 2024 election. In August, Sook made his move, announcing Nexstar had a deal in place to acquire its competitor Tegna, another major TV-affiliate owner, for $6.2 billion pending regulatory approval(...).\n\n>Enter Kimmel, who, in his late-night comedy show’s monologue on Monday, said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” As my colleague Joe Adalian covered in his breakdown of Kimmel’s cancellation, this was enough to trigger a rebuke on Wednesday from FCC chairman Brendan Carr — the man leading the regulator that would review any merger Nexstar would make.\n\n>“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr told right-wing YouTuber Benny Johnson. “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” He also called out the power of the FCC to revoke broadcast licenses: “They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.”",

        "body": "Some points from this piece:\n\n>After endless delays, Trump insiders claim to be zeroing in on a deal that would sell 80% of TikTok’s U.S. assets to Andreessen Horowitz (owned by Marc Andreessen, an increasingly incoherent right wing billionaire and close Trump ally), Oracle (owned by Larry Ellison, a rabidly right wing billionaire and close Trump ally), and Silver Lake (a hedge fund with a history of… predatory and dodgy behaviors).\n>\n>Andreessen and Ellison are, to be clear, technofascists who don’t believe in democracy, regulatory oversight, or basic privacy protections for consumers. The remaining 20 percent would remain in the hands of Chinese ownership and the Chinese government, which still has to finalize the deal. This is not, contrary to what you’ll read in the pages of WAPO or CNN, a net improvement.\n>\n>Oh, and Donald Trump will get to appoint a board member. Remember when Republicans were against government interference in private businesses?\n>\n>If you recall, selling TikTok to Trump’s buddies was always his goal (remember he originally wanted it split between Walmart and Oracle). It just got temporarily disrupted by his 2020 election loss.\n>\n>Trump still didn’t truly get what he really wanted: reporting in the Financial Times suggests that China will still technically own and control the algorithm used to power TikTok, something Trump had previously said was essential to any deal. Early reporting by the Wall Street Journal also indicates that existing TikTok users will have to migrate to a new app.\n>\n>...\n>\n>I’ve noted more times than I can count that the push to ban TikTok was never really about protecting American privacy. If that were true, we would pass a real privacy law and craft serious penalties for companies and executives that play fast and loose with sensitive American data, be it TikTok or the myriad of super dodgy apps, telecoms, and hardware vendors monetizing your phone usage.\n>\n>It was never really about propaganda. If that were true, we’d take aim at the extremely well funded authoritarian propaganda machine and engage in content moderation of race-baiting political propaganda that’s filling the brains of young American men with pudding and hate. We’d push for education media literacy reforms common in countries like Finland.\n>\n>Banning TikTok was never really about national security. If that were true, we wouldn’t be dismantling our cybersecurity regulators, accidentally hosting sensitive military chats over Signal with journalists, voting to cement utterly incompetent knobs in unaccountable roles across military intelligence, and letting dodgy data brokers sell sensitive personal info to global governments (including our own).\n>\n>TikTok’s Chinese ownership did pose some very real legitimate security, privacy, and NatSec concerns, but the MAGA folks “fixing” the problem were never competent or good faith actors, and the push to ban hijack TikTok was always about ego, money, and information control. \n>\n>...\n>\n>Larry Ellison in particular has been very keen to leverage his massive wealth gains during the Trump era(s) to buy every new and old media venture his family can get its hands on, from CBS and CNN (Time Warner), to TikTok. Trump’s FCC is busy stripping away whatever is left of media consolidation limits to accommodate this massive right wing power grab. And TikTok’s a very central piece of the puzzle.\n>\n>American authoritarians are following the same playbook we’ve seen in countries like Hungary, where new and old media and journalism is either destroyed or hijacked in service to authoritarian leadership. It’s happening here, now, and the very least ethical people can do is recognize it and put up a fight.\n\nFrom this perspective it certainly seems that we are very much in a new gilded age with tech billionaires now looking to control an ever larger chunk of our lives. The technologies that have been created and pushed by these people and companies are accelerating this control, and so far the public seems to be going along with it. The parallels between what's happening now and what's happened in places like Hungary could be instructive, if people are willing to learn about them.",

Therefore, the VFC program will continue to cover MMRV vaccines for children under age 4. This is a split from standard policy that is likely to spur confusion, because VFC typically goes with ACIP recommendations. Also, Medicaid's Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has to follow the ACIP vaccine recommendation and thus will no longer cover MMRV for children under age 4 covered by CHIP.\n\nThat sounds at least somewhat encouraging? I mean, if you're running an insurance company and your goal is to spend as little money as possible on payouts, doesn't it make sense to cover vaccines that prevent children from getting debilitating diseases? Vaccines are cheap, hospital stays and prolonged treatment regimens are expensive. Why wouldn't the insurance companies continue to cover them when every group of medical professionals under the sun recommends them? Those companies know as well as anyone else that RFK's HHS isn't making evidence-based decisions here.\n\nThat CHIP exclusion is tragic, though. It truly is terrible that the country's poorest children will be the ones to suffer most from this. Kennedy and his anti-science goons are play acting at being medical professionals and gambling with lives in the process. It doesn't matter how republican your representative and your district may be, we should all be emailing and calling to demand that RFK Jr be removed because he and his band of clowns are putting lives at risk.",

But a lot of virtual idols are in fact the result of actual people performing in motion capture suits and recording in studios.\n\nThe boygroup mentioned here, PLAVE, fits the latter definition. It's five guys playing five guys, basically.\n\nNow PLAVE is also very different in two ways.\n\nOne, virtual idols in Korea are typically fairly niche, and tend to remain in a fandom bubble. However, PLAVE not only have a large fandom in Korea, but they've also been quite successful with the general public, with one of their singles hitting #1 on the Circle Digital Charts last year.\n\nSecondly, virtual idols usually keep their real identities hidden. Fans usually view any discussion or revelation of personal details as a violation of privacy. But in the case of PLAVE, some members were formerly members of 'real' boy groups, and so their real identities are a bit of an open secret.\n\nWhat's even worse is that PLAVE member Eunho, in his 'former life', had released a mixtape with a song containing misogynistic lyrics. He did issue an apology for it, but it didn't really work.\n\nSo basically PLAVE has a pretty big target on their back. As a non-fan who really doesn't keep up with the group, I have seen a lot of hate towards them, and since 4/5 members real identities are known, their company is not just suing to protect digital avatars, but also the real people behind them.",
