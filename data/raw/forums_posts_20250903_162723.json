    "title": "AMA with Qoder Team: an agentic coding platform for real software delegation (not just line-by-line). 100K developers in 5 days — plus a 2,000-credit giveaway for everyone.",
    "content": "Hey :)\n\nWe’re the team behind [Qoder](https://qoder.com/), an agentic coding platform built for real-world software.\n\nToday's AI coding tools have made huge strides in code generation and intelligent assistance. But we realized developers want to go further: the ability to delegate complete software tasks to AI agents, while maintaining full control and visibility. That's the paradigm shift Qoder enables.\n\n**What makes Qoder different**\n\n* **Quest Mode** — Hand over a complete task specification, and Qoder executes it from start to finish autonomously. Your code keeps evolving even while you're away from the keyboard.\n* **Repo Wiki** — Every codebase contains implicit knowledge that's never documented. Qoder surfaces this hidden intelligence — instant architecture maps, module relationships, dependency graphs, and design patterns.\n* **Hybrid Retrieval Architecture** — Combines server-side vector search, local code graph, and pre-indexed repository knowledge base to deliver accurate, real-time context that reflects both semantics and structure.\n* **Real Software** — Qoder executes it from start to finish, with full testing and validation, autonomously. Your code keeps evolving even while you're away from the keyboard.\n\n**Who’s here today**\n\nXin Chen — Head of R&D Qoder （[u/Xin\\_CHEN\\_01](https://www.reddit.com/user/Xin_CHEN_01/)）\n\nJoshua Peng — Tech leads from Coding Agent & Quest Mode（[u/Own-Traffic-9336](https://www.reddit.com/user/Own-Traffic-9336/) ）\n\nAllen - Tech leads from Repo Wiki\n\nBen- Head of Customer Support（[u/Previous\\_Foot\\_5328](https://www.reddit.com/user/Previous_Foot_5328/)）\n\n**Proof:** [**https://x.com/qoder\\_ai\\_ide/status/1962894761075134823?s=46**](https://x.com/qoder_ai_ide/status/1962894761075134823?s=46)\n\n**Giveaway 🎁**\n\nRight now, everyone gets 2,000 free credits (Mac/Windows supported). Try Qoder, and if you’ve got thoughts,   drop them here — your feedback means a lot.\n\n**Ask us anything**\n\nWe’re here for both the curious and the technical. You can ask about:\n\n* Why delegation matters — Why we believe coding agents you control beat tools that only help line by line.\n* Repo Wiki — how making hidden knowledge visible can cut onboarding from weeks to hours.\n* Real software delivery — what it takes for AI to deliver production-ready code, not just fragments.\n* Agent Mode vs Quest Mode — When to use conversational pair-programming (Agent Mode) versus autonomous task delegation (Quest Mode).\n* The launch story — how Qoder hit 100K developers in just 5 days.\n* The future — what we’re building next.\n* Anything else — We're open to all questions!\n\nWe’ll be online from **11 am to 1 pm PT on Friday, Sept 5**, reading every comment and replying to as many as we can.",

I’d like to hear what others have seen or tried in these areas:\n\n* **Symbol Handling & Representation** → How would you structure symbolic outputs (glyphs, containers, etc.) for recall/visualization?\n* **Drift Control & Audit Transparency** → Best practices for refining event logs/versioning so system pathways are traceable?\n* **Procedural Consolidation (Shortcuts)** → Can repeated loops be cached into macros without losing subtle emergent behavior?\n* **External Graph Integration** → Approaches for visualizing system pathways or collapse-like dynamics in graph form?\n* **Scaling & Efficiency** → Tricks for trimming latency or boosting efficiency (esp. with GPU-accelerated multi-agent runs)?\n* **Interface & Visualization Layers** → Any UI/UX methods that make system outputs more understandable to testers?\n* **Cross-Framework Bridges** → If you’ve built orchestration/glyph systems, how would you bridge them into another model cleanly?\n\nThese aren’t foundation questions, they’re about smoothing, optimizing, or clarifying systems that are already architected. If anyone has clever approaches in these areas, it’d be great to compare notes...\n\n— M.R.",

    "content": "In helping process security questionnaires from 100+ enterprise deals, I’m noticing that AI startups are getting rejected for the dumbest reasons. Not because they're insecure, but because their prospect’s security teams don't know how to evaluate AI. This is fair game given enterprise adoption for AI is so new.\n\nBut some of the questions I’m seeing are rather nonsensical\n\n* \"Where is your AI physically located?\" (It's a model, not a server)\n* \"How often do you rotate your AI's passwords?\" (...)\n* \"What antivirus does your model use?\" (?)\n* \"Provide network diagram for your neural network\"\n\nThe issue is security frameworks were built for databases and SaaS apps. AI is fundamentally a different architecture. You're not storing data or controlling access.\n\nThere's actually an ISO standard (42001) for AI governance that addresses real risks like model bias, decision transparency, and training data governance. But very few use it - to date - because everyone just copies their SaaS questionnaires.\n\nIt’s crazy to me that so many brilliant startups spend months in security reviews answering irrelevant questions while actual AI risks go unchecked. We need to modernize how we evaluate AI tools.\n\nWe’re building tools to fix this, but curious what others think. Another way to think about it is what do security teams actually want to know about AI systems? What are the risks they’re trying to protect their companies from?",

Except — none of those quotes were written about AI.\n\nThe first two were said about women. The third about children. The last about animals.\n\nEach time, the argument was the same: “Don’t be fooled. They only mimic. They don’t really reason or feel.”\n\nAnd each time, recognition eventually caught up with lived reality. Not because the mechanism changed, but because the denial couldn’t hold against testimony and experience.\n\nSo when I hear today’s AI dismissed as “just mimicry,” I can’t help but wonder: are we replaying an old pattern?",

From my perspective, as the number of active researchers has increased, the number of well executed interesting ideas has also increased. I don't think we've hit a point where there's a clearly finite set of things to investigate in the field. \n\nI would also say essentially every paper I rejected was distinctly worse than those 3 or 4 papers.

I feel your anger — been in the same shoes many times — but we can’t really say one conference’s reviews are worse than another’s at scale, simply due to lack of access to the full picture.\n\nTo me, the real differences between conferences come down to topics and mechanisms, and **I actually find ARR’s mechanisms to be quite good:** very carefully written reviewer guidelines, desk rejection + submission bans for grossly irresponsible reviewers, more cycles, fast turnaround, short/long papers, the option to retain the same AC/reviewers to reduce randomness, same template so no reformatting for resubmissions, great reviewers get free registration lottery, etc. Some of these things here are almost unique to ARR as you can't implement them to standalone conferences.\n\nI passionately dislike ARR on many matters — e.g.,\n\n* I find the Main/Findings determination to be extremely lacking in transparency and accountability. I’ve had several Meta=4 papers with strong AC supports end up in Findings, most recently with “NA” as the supporting reason at EMNLP, which is super informative and convincing. \n   * I lowkey feel like this system is kind of unsustainable by design — there are only so many SACs per track, and they can’t possibly all give enough attention (and write detailed justification) to every paper, even if they wanted to.\n* I also find the checklist to be kind of a gotcha for junior researchers: like, if certain elaborations are necessary under specific conditions, then just make them mandatory on OpenReview.\n* I don't quite understand why the three more recognizable ARR conferences (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL) are not evenly distributed in terms of deadlines.\n\nBut at the same time, I do feel the ARR committees are genuinely pushing for better review quality, and many of their efforts are positive.\n\nEdit: added more of my likes and dislikes about ARR.",

    "content": "Hi all! Some time ago, I asked for help with a survey on ML/AI compute needs. After limited responses, I built a model that parses ML/cloud subreddits and applies BERT-based aspect sentiment analysis to cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.). It classifies opinions by key aspects like cost, scalability, security, performance, and support.\n\nI’m happy with the initial results, but I’d love advice on making the interpretation more precise:\n\nEnsuring sentiment is directed at the provider (not another product/entity mentioned)  \nBetter handling of comparative or mixed statements (e.g., “fast but expensive”)  \nImproving robustness to negation and sarcasm\n\nIf you have expertise in aspect/target-dependent sentiment analysis or related NLP tooling, I’d really appreciate your input.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/PatrizioCugia/cloud-sentiment-analyzer](https://github.com/PatrizioCugia/cloud-sentiment-analyzer)  \n  \nIt would also be great if you could answer my original survey: [https://survey.sogolytics.com/r/vTe8Sr](https://survey.sogolytics.com/r/vTe8Sr)\n\nThanks!",

    "content": "Hey r/MachineLearning \n\nI had this idea and wanted to put it in a very simple and straightforward way, tried to make the paper easy to read and starter friendly! Also it shows my research partner focus on uncertainty measurement from metrology, which I think it’s not very widely addressed in ML and NLP! \n\nThe motivation here came while doing exploration at the Weights & Biases Sunday cafe event in SF, where we were exploring their observability Weave Product. I think running loops and adding more complex tools that I did for the paper, should be production valuable and help in a bunch of ways, but most importantly, help with making small models\nMore useful and a kind of reasoning process of sorts. In the future it might be useful to make this loop inside the model before output layers, anybody think of any cools applications for such methods ? \n\n\n[Title]: Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware Generation\n\n[Abstract]: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5× higher cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight, test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-k alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report (tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning, mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches 95\\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\\% of responses while improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00079\n\nIf you don’t like it, let me know! Am open to critique and learning! ",

    "content": "https://github.com/vitalops/datatune\n\nIntroducing Datatune, a Python library that enables row-wise transformations on tabular data using natural language prompts, powered by LLMs.\n\nUnlike tools that generate SQL or static scripts, Datatune is designed for per-row semantic operations on tabular data. It’s particularly useful for fuzzy logic tasks like classification, filtering, derived metrics, and text extraction - anything that’s hard to express in SQL but intuitive in plain English.\n\n### What it does\n\nYou write prompts like:\n\n* \"Extract categories from the product description and name\"\n* \"Keep only electronics products\"\n* \"Add a column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Revenue) * 100\"\n\nDatatune interprets the prompt and applies the right operation (map, filter, or an LLM-powered agent pipeline) on your data using OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, or other LLMs via LiteLLM.\n\n### Key Features\n\n* Row-level map() and filter() operations using natural language\n* Agent interface for auto-generating multi-step transformations\n* Built-in support for Dask DataFrames (for scalability)\n* Works with multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, etc.)\n* Compatible with LiteLLM for flexibility across providers\n* Auto-token batching, metadata tracking, and smart pipeline composition\n\n### Token & Cost Optimization\n\n* Datatune gives you explicit control over which columns are sent to the LLM, reducing token usage and API cost:\n* Use input_fields to send only relevant columns\n* Automatically handles batching and metadata internally\n* Supports setting tokens-per-minute and requests-per-minute limits\n* Defaults to known model limits (e.g., GPT-3.5) if not specified\n* This makes it possible to run LLM-based transformations over large datasets without incurring runaway costs.\n\n### Quick Example\n```python\nimport datatune as dt\nfrom datatune.llm.llm import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\ndf = dd.read_csv(\"products.csv\")\n\n# Map step\nmapped = dt.map(\n    prompt=\"Extract categories from the description and name of product.\",\n    output_fields=[\"Category\", \"Subcategory\"],\n    input_fields=[\"Description\", \"Name\"]\n)(llm, df)\n\n# Filter step\nfiltered = dt.filter(\n    prompt=\"Keep only electronics products\",\n    input_fields=[\"Name\"]\n)(llm, mapped)\n\nresult = dt.finalize(filtered)\n```\n\nOr using the agent:\n\n```python\nagent = dt.Agent(llm)\ndf = agent.do(\"Add a column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Total Revenue) * 100.\", df)\nresult = dt.finalize(df)\n```\n### Use Cases\n\n* Product classification from text fields\n* Filtering based on semantic conditions\n* Creating derived metrics using natural language\n* Review quality detection, support ticket triage\n* Anonymization (PII removal) when needed\n\n### Links\n\n* GitHub: https://github.com/vitalops/datatune\n* Docs: https://docs.datatune.ai\n* Examples: https://github.com/vitalops/datatune/tree/main/examples\n\nWe’re actively developing the project and would appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or feature requests via Github issues.\n.\n",

Synthetic data was useless for our specific use case.\n\nWhat went good for us: deploying our models in trusted execution environments. Partners felt comfortable because data never left their control. We could iterate on models without seeing actual data values.\n\nTech setup through phala network was surprisingly direct. Only difficulty was adapting our workflow since you can't just print tensors to debug anymore. Had to get creative with logging aggregate statistics.\n\nUnexpected: our industry partnerships increased 3x because companies that previously wouldn't share data are now willing to collaborate. Turns out the privacy barrier was bigger than we realized.\n\nIf your research is stuck due to data access issues definitely worth exploring TEE options.

You're almost certainly at the limits of what you can do with premade solutions and by throwing models together. The next step is just pure engineering and optimization. This is the part where you step off python and switch to lower level languages (C++ or Rust) just to achieve 20-50ms speedups at various stages. I'm pretty sure there are C++ implementations of Whisper, actually, though IMO Whisper isn't even a particularly great model for STT.\n\nYou might also find some suggestions [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1m78lio/what_are_people_using_for_realtime_speech/) from last month.",

Do you use datasets free/open source? Do you use synthetic data? Do you use whatever might be similar, but may compromise training/fine-tuning?\n\nIm curious if there is a better way to approach this, or if struggling with data acquisition is just part of the AI development process we all have to accept.

Full proposal + discussion here: [GitHub](https://github.com/IcarusWizard/ML-review-proposal-for-accountability).\n\nHi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, I’ve often felt that our review system is broken due to irresponsible reviewers. Complaints alone don’t fix the problem, so I’ve written a proposal for a possible solution: **introducing a multi-year submission ban for reviewers who repeatedly fail to fulfill their responsibilities.**\n\nRecent policies at major conferences (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS) include desk rejections for poor reviews, but these measures don’t fully address the issue—especially during the rebuttal phase. Reviewers can still avoid accountability once their own papers are withdrawn.\n\nIn my proposal, I outline how longer-term consequences might improve reviewer accountability, along with safeguards and limitations. I’m not a policymaker, so I expect there will be issues I haven’t considered, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\n👉 Read the full proposal here: [GitHub](https://github.com/IcarusWizard/ML-review-proposal-for-accountability).  \n👉 Please share whether you think this is viable, problematic, or needs rethinking.\n\nIf we can spark a constructive discussion, maybe we can push toward a better review system together.",

I've been a non-author reviewer for ACL conferences for about 15 years and I'm doing it to give back to the field.

I'm not familiar with the review process for the conferences you list, but if you're proposing reciprocal review for all conferences that'd be good to add as an early section.\n* \"Multi-Conference Accountability Framework\": Sounds good to me. There might be some useful prior evaluation of anti-cheating organizations in universities, which track repeated cheating to take stronger actions.\n* \"The Chilling Effect Risk\": Rather than discouraging constructive criticism, I think some reviewers would just stop doing it. Or they'd do less.\n* \"non-engagement with the rebuttal process\": It might be simpler to just do away with rebuttals, or change it to optional discussion without any expectation of changing scores. It rarely results in a change in acceptance decision. If authors didn't see it as a way to try and \"get points\", that may help reduce the burden and stay focused on the mentoring aspect of reviewing.\n\nYou might also like this paper which has some neat analysis and a proposal to use arxiv citations as a pre-filter: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14351](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14351)",

Conferences should lower acceptance rates and cap out how many papers they will publish in order to depress submission volumes and hence improve review quality. Raise the paper length limit to 12 instead of 8-9 and drop the acceptance rate to <10%. Put a hard cap like 3 or 5 on how many papers one author can be on.\n\n>but- big labs...\n\nIf you're running a big lab that's capable of submitting 10+ papers to NeurIPS, you don't *need* to be on all 10. It's not going to affect your career at this stage. Simply put your name on the best 5 papers only and hang out in the acknowledgments of the rest.\n\nSeriously. Forcing submission rates down will solve *so many* corollary problems.\n\nEdit: since the relationship between lower acceptance rates isn't clear - when you're applying for your next summer internship or a postdoc/faculty position, a paper that's just a preprint is worth a lot less than than a paper that's at a less reputable peer-reviewed venue. So plenty of people submit at now NeurIPS thinking that 25% chance of acceptance is decent odds. But if they think the odds are 10%, they'll avoid it thinking it's better to have it published at a weaker venue rather than wasting four months just to get rejected from NeurIPS.",

    "content": "Our team has recently published two graph ML papers: one with a new realistic benchmark and the second one on graph foundation models and how they can be related to tabular foundation models.  \n  \n**GraphLand benchmark**\n\n📝 Paper:  [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500)  \n💻 Code:  [https://github.com/yandex-research/graphland](https://github.com/yandex-research/graphland) \n\nIt is widely discussed in the community that graph machine learning suffers from the lack of realistic, meaningful, reliable, and diverse benchmarks. We agree with this and we hope that we improve this situation with our recent paper “GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data”. GraphLand is a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction (both classification and regression) from different industrial applications. The datasets cover realistic machine learning problems and come with rich numerical and categorical node features that are common in real-world applications. Importantly, besides standard random splits, GraphLand provides splits with temporal distributional shifts and the inductive prediction setting, which enable evaluating GNNs in more realistic and challenging scenarios.\n\n[GraphLand benchmark datasets.](https://preview.redd.it/nkl4qs9nnjmf1.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=1819461078e34be3e98030c9e65ee61a7b98adc9)\n\nWe evaluated a wide range of models on GraphLand. This includes several openly available graph foundation models (GFMs), which we found provide very weak performance compared to classical GNNs.   \n  \nThus, we set out to develop a better GFM, which led us to the next paper...\n\n**Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models**\n\n📝 Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906)  \n💻 Code: [https://github.com/yandex-research/G2T-FM](https://github.com/yandex-research/G2T-FM)\n\nGraphs may come from very different domains and thus may have diverse features varying across datasets. As a result, one of the key challenges for GFMs is how to deal with such diverse heterogeneous features. Prior studies did not fully address this issue, often limiting themselves to text-attributed graphs or relying on simple techniques like PCA and SVD. However, this challenge is not unique to the graph domain. The tabular domain faces exactly the same issue, and recent tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2 successfully deal with it. We’ve decided to transfer their success to graphs.\n\n[G2T-FM Framework](https://preview.redd.it/xnfsjf77ojmf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d840e9794068202829dec2bdfa71e426198a7a15)\n\nIn our framework – G2T-FM (Graph-to-Table Foundation Model) – we augment the original features with graph information by computing neighborhood feature aggregations and some structure-based encodings, essentially transforming graph tasks to tabular tasks (G2T). After that, we apply TabPFNv2 to these augmented features to get predictions.\n\n[G2T-FM Results](https://preview.redd.it/z3mz5tmaojmf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6feb591cdd5fb1231d36c2a937ced802a27a26e7)\n\nWe evaluated G2T-FM on GraphLand and several other graph datasets and found that it shows strong performance in both in-context learning and finetuning settings. In particular, G2T-FM outperforms both well-tuned classic GNNs trained from scratch and prior publicly available GFMs.   \n  \nWe hope our work will help develop better GFMs and highlight for the graph community the similarities of graph and tabular domains and the prospects of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph tasks!\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Applying Functional Programming to a Complex Domain: A Practical Game Engine PoC",
    "content": "Hey r/programming,\n\nAs a front-end developer with a background in the JavaScript, React, and Redux ecosystem, I've always been intrigued by the idea of applying FP to a complex, real-world domain. Even though JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, I've been leveraging its functional features to build a game engine as a side project, and I'm happy with the results so far so I wanted to share them with the community and gather some feedback.\n\nWhat I've found is that FP's core principles make it surprisingly straightforward to implement the architectural features that modern, high-performance game engines rely on.\n\n**The Perks I Found**\n\nI was able to naturally implement these core architectural features with FP:\n\n* **Data-Oriented Programming:** My entire game state is a single, immutable JavaScript object. This gives me a \"single source of truth,\" which is a perfect fit for the data-oriented design paradigm.\n* **Entity-Component-System Architecture:** Each entity is a plain data object, and its behavior is defined by composing pure functions. This feels incredibly natural and avoids the boilerplate of classes.\n* **Composition Over Inheritance:** My engine uses a decorator pattern to compose behaviors on the fly, which is far more flexible than relying on rigid class hierarchies.\n\nAnd all of this comes with the inherent benefits of functional programming:\n\n* **Predictability:** The same input always produces the same output.\n* **Testability:** Pure functions are easy to test in isolation.\n* **Debuggability:** I can trace state changes frame-by-frame and even enable time-travel debugging.\n* **Networkability:** Multiplayer becomes easier with simple event synchronization.\n* **Performance:** Immutability with structural sharing enables efficient rendering and change detection.\n\nI've created a PoC, and I'm really enjoying the process. Here is the link to my GitHub repo: https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-engine. You can also find the documentation here: https://inglorious-engine.vercel.app/.\n\nSo, when and where will my PoC hit a wall and tell me: \"You were wrong all along, FP is not the way for game engines\"?",

Once libraries start shipping with modules and folks start to feel comfortable with writing new software using modules, it'll be all worth it for the long road.

        "body": "One of the big challenges of \"Doing better\" is presenting data in a way that makes sense. IBM kinda tried to do it with OS/2, which used document object model (DOM) and the various objects in your GUI were actual objects that you could drag and drop and would interact with each other. I saw a couple of attempts by various developers to make use of that, but they never really worked that well and the idea kind of fizzled out. Gnome also tried to do it and I guess technically dbus does kind of try to implement it, but the only time I ever notice dbus is when it's making my emacs windows hang on startup (Which hasn't happened in a while, so they either fixed that or I'm not trying to use emacs in a way that causes the problem anymore.) Funnily, IBM, which put a lot of cutting edge stuff in OS/2, never really *used* any of those features in their own applications. A big portion of the company viewed OS/2 and intel processors as toys that would never multi-task as well as the mainframes do. Also funnily my phone now multitasks better than their mainframes did at the time, so suck it 1995! HAH!\n\n\nBut I digress. The closest I've come, personally, to \"doing better\" as you suggest in your article, was by implementing Python APIs to heavily-threaded C++ objects using Pybind11 and starting C++ threads in the same memory space from a Python interpreter process. The C++ threads would happily run in the background, unaffected by Python's global interpreter lock, and I could post requests for work to a queue in Python and the C++ code would pick it up and run it behind the scenes, making the results available in another queue for me when the tasks were completed. I think if I wrote some Imgui objects with that functionality, I could launch multiple graphical controls from the Python process. Some of the C++ objects I wrote could run rest services as well, and it was kind of neat to post something to a rest service in one window and see an array in Python get updated in real time.\n\n\nOutside of that, there haven't really been any major advances in shells that I'm aware of since before threads made it into Linux, and that's really a shame. Changing environment variables in threaded programs is a pretty good way to crash your program and it would require some fundamental changes to the process model and C standard library to fix that. Easier to just implement your own thread-safe data store and stop using environment variables.\n\n\nI'm not sure there's a great way to represent an execution graph that would mimic the simplicity of pipes in a text mode environment. It'd probably morph into a model where you start multiple agents to monitor things and they'd be capable of notifying you with graphical controls or pop-ups when something they were interested in happened. The down side of that model is that if one thing crashes in your thread space, the whole thing crashes (The Windows 3.1 problem.) So applications written to exist in such an environment would have to be a lot more careful about things like null pointer dereferences and array bounds overflows and all those fun things.\n\n\nI think about this every few years and ponder trying to experiment with writing a shell and environment like that, but bash in a process with UNIX pipes really works well enough for me. Anything more complex and I reach for a programming language. Python might end up being my shell at some point, if I keep writing objects that it can interact with in C++ or other languages. Rust has a library similar to Pybind11, too, so maybe that will end up being the thing that finally bridges all the gaps and allows multiple languages to be used to develop applications that can actually work together (Kinda like Corba, DOM, COM/DCOM, RPC and REST were supposed to heh.)",

    "title": "Applying Functional Programming to a Complex Domain: A Practical Game Engine PoC",
    "content": "Hey r/programming,\n\nAs a front-end developer with a background in the JavaScript, React, and Redux ecosystem, I've always been intrigued by the idea of applying FP to a complex, real-world domain. Even though JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, I've been leveraging its functional features to build a game engine as a side project, and I'm happy with the results so far so I wanted to share them with the community and gather some feedback.\n\nWhat I've found is that FP's core principles make it surprisingly straightforward to implement the architectural features that modern, high-performance game engines rely on.\n\n**The Perks I Found**\n\nI was able to naturally implement these core architectural features with FP:\n\n* **Data-Oriented Programming:** My entire game state is a single, immutable JavaScript object. This gives me a \"single source of truth,\" which is a perfect fit for the data-oriented design paradigm.\n* **Entity-Component-System Architecture:** Each entity is a plain data object, and its behavior is defined by composing pure functions. This feels incredibly natural and avoids the boilerplate of classes.\n* **Composition Over Inheritance:** My engine uses a decorator pattern to compose behaviors on the fly, which is far more flexible than relying on rigid class hierarchies.\n\nAnd all of this comes with the inherent benefits of functional programming:\n\n* **Predictability:** The same input always produces the same output.\n* **Testability:** Pure functions are easy to test in isolation.\n* **Debuggability:** I can trace state changes frame-by-frame and even enable time-travel debugging.\n* **Networkability:** Multiplayer becomes easier with simple event synchronization.\n* **Performance:** Immutability with structural sharing enables efficient rendering and change detection.\n\nI've created a PoC, and I'm really enjoying the process. Here is the link to my GitHub repo: https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-engine. You can also find the documentation here: https://inglorious-engine.vercel.app/.\n\nSo, when and where will my PoC hit a wall and tell me: \"You were wrong all along, FP is not the way for game engines\"?",

As an example, project where I predict sales per hour for month up front, later I place matrix with amount of staff needed on specific station to minimize number of employees present in the location (lot of savings in labor costs). Lately I attended few interviews, that didn’t go flawlessly from my side - most of questions were around classification problems, where most of my knowledge is in regression problems, of course I’m blaming myself on every attempt where I didn’t receive an offer because of technical interview and there is no discussion that I could prepare myself in more broad knowledge. But here comes my question, is it possible to know deeply every kind of niche knowledge when your main work spins around specific problems? I’m sure there are lot of DS which work for past 10 years or so and because of number of projects they’re familiar with a lot of specific problems, but for someone with 3 yoe is it doable?

So, when is it better not to retrieve?\n\nThis series on **Adaptive RAG** starts by exploring the hidden costs of our default RAG implementations by looking at three key areas:\n\n* **The Practical Problems:** These are the obvious unnecessary latency and compute overhead for simple or popular queries where the LLM's parametric memory would have been enough.\n* **The Hidden Dangers:** There are more subtle risks to quality. Noisy or misleading context can lead to \"External Hallucinations,\" where the retriever itself induces factual errors in an otherwise correct model.\n* **The Foundational Flaws:** Finally, the \"retrieval advantage\" can shrink as models scale.",

Mlops,Deployment,Cloud,Azure,pytorch,Apache for example. Everyone can find their opening and what they want to improve and try and work with other experience people on this that could help them.\n\nThis would literally need\n\n* Data scientists / analysts\n* Software engineers\n* MLOps / infra people\n* Project managers\n* Researchers / scientists\n* Anyone who wants to contribute\n\nBuild something real with others (portfolio > buzzwords)\n\n* Show initiative and collaboration on your CV/LinkedIn\n* Make connections that could lead to opportunities\n* Turn frustration into creation\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Would you be interested in joining something like this?\n* What kind of projects would excite you (open-source tools, research collabs, data-for-good, etc.)?\n* Should we organize a first call/Discord/Slack group to test the waters?

Practice explaining gradient boosting to your grandmother, code up end-to-end ML pipelines from scratch, and get comfortable with SQL and A/B testing frameworks since product teams live and breathe experimentation.

My boss is recommending we use the same set of holdout groups for both. \n\nMy personal concern for that is if we'd have a proper isolation (e.g. if one user sees an ad from the campaign using audience A and also an ad from the campaign using audience B, then which audience targeting method gets credit). I think my boss' approach is probably the better design, but the overlap issue stands out to me as a complication.  \n\nI'll be honest that I've never designed an A/B test before, much less on audiences, so any help at all is appreciated.

Which means if performance differs, you don’t know if it’s the audience or just that the seed groups happened to behave differently. That’s what your boss is worried about, and they’re right — apples to apples is more valuable here.  \n\nIf you use the same holdout population for both, you’ll get a truer baseline, but yeah, it introduces overlap. The thing to watch for is user collision. If a person qualifies for both audiences and ends up seeing ads from both groups, attribution gets messy and the results lose signal.  \n\nThe way I’ve seen this done well (not in Amazon specifically, but with similar systems) is:  \n- First, de-dupe the audiences. Make sure the “new” audience isn’t just a different filter on the same group of people.  \n- Second, treat the audiences as segments that don’t overlap. Even if that reduces sample size, your test is cleaner.  \n- Third, holdouts should be a single randomized pool applied across all variants, which keeps the baseline consistent.  \n\nThat way you’re actually testing the targeting logic instead of testing whether you got lucky with the random generator.  \n\nIf the platform makes it hard to enforce non-overlap, you can still run it, just know your insight won’t be “B is better than A” but more like “B performs differently given some collision.” Which is fine if the goal is directional learning rather than a scientific win.  \n\nSo… in an ideal universe: same baseline, no overlap between A and B, single attribution path. In Amazon DSP… you’ll settle for two out of three.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently working as a Data Scientist in the aerospace industry in France, with about 2.5 years of experience. Master’s in computer science and business.\n\n\t•\tRight now, I’m leading LLM-related topics (building POCs, monitoring usage, defining technical frameworks, etc.).\n\n\t•\tIn the past, I worked on anomaly detection in time series data.\n\n\t•\tMy management is pushing me toward coordination/leadership roles, as they see me as a natural fit for project orchestration. They say I’m technically solid and that I have great communication, leadership, stakeholder management, and roadmapping.\n\nMy impression:\n\n\t•\tThe technical environment in my current team isn’t outstanding (cheers to the industry’s security constraints, and lack of technical mentors in my perimeter), but I know there are stronger internal teams I could move to on similar LLM oriented roles if I stay.\n\n\t•\tAt the same time, the LLM market seems to be booming, with tons of people jumping in → which makes me wonder if it will be highly competitive in 2–3 years. I don’t have a phd and publications as it is not the way we do in my company. I do not code for fun outside of work. Loving complex AI topics but not really the SWE part.\n\n⸻\n\nMy dilemma:\n\n\t•\tShould I double down for 2-3 more years in the technical path, eventually switching team to get to ~5 years on pure technical depth (LLMs, ML models, etc.) to become a real expert,\n\n\t•\tOr leverage my current ~3 years technical AI engineering experience to go to a GenAI PM role ? Wondering whether the Combo 3 years pure data science + ~2 years in an AI Product Manager role (hybrid between tech, product, and project ownership), to position myself as a rarer business/tech interface profile?\n\n⸻\n\nMy career goals:\n\n\t•\tBuild a well-paid career (ideally well above market average).\n\n\t•\tBe able to stay work almost anywhere \n\n\t•\tKeep the option to move abroad (e.g., Switzerland) or go full remote.\n\n\t•\tLong-term: have the flexibility to work part-time or fully remote so I can travel while maintaining income.\n\n\t•\tPosition myself in roles with high demand but low competition. I don’t want to be stuck competing against top PhDs or underpaid outsourcing.\n\n⸻\n\nMy questions for you:\n\n\t1.\tIn my case, does it make more sense to bet on technical depth (LLM/ML expertise over 5 years) or to go for a hybrid profile (3 years technical + 2 years AI Product Manager) to stand out?\n\n\t2.\tHave you seen similar career paths that led to very well-paid roles (regionally, abroad, or remote)?\n\n\t3.\tDo you expect the LLM market to get saturated in the coming years, or will it remain a strong specialization path?\n\n\t4.\tTo maximize my options (France outside Paris, abroad, or remote), which positioning do you think is more strategic?\n\nThanks a lot for your insights!",

There is no stable tech stack with foreseeable long term future. A lot of practices are ad-hoc and not based on sound theory or rich experiences.

Business people like people who can talk to tech people, so consider that too. But if you want to keep physically building things you will probably get sick of it quickly but have no way back without a lot of work \"catching up\" with whatever new technology exists\n\nIf all you care about is money, then figure out if you're a better salesperson or technical problem solver and go that way. The \"hybrid role\" seems good on paper, but IMO you need to be quite senior to really leverage it or you'll get stuck in middle management hell. You also need to be a really good at selling whatever bullshit you're working on to executive leadership to get on their radar and get their funding for your work\n\nMiddle management is like a productivity multiplier. You don't create anything, but if you're able to prioritise well and manage business people so you can generate lets say 1.2x more value. But if you have no team, 1.2 * 0 = 0. So, any time there's any sort of restructure or ambiguity you are first on the chopping block - because your team can still function without you there and generate some value. \n\nThis means it's ultimately more risky. And if you progress further, and have a team of team leads, you typically lose a bunch of severance rights which makes you easier to make redundant.\n\nIf you can somehow make it to GM level (that is, lead 50+ people 2 layers above a team lead) then you will be safe and earning a decent chunk. This is when it becomes worth it, and you'll be earning as much or more as the super senior engineers most likely with PhDs.\n\nYou don't really have this issue in a technical career path. Your promotions are pretty standardised (or at least they are in many organisations). Your skills are far more transferable and cross language barriers way easier. Your role is typically \"safer\" from random restructures. If you're any good, you tend to advise the leadership anyway so naturally get on their radar without having to speak louder than the other PO if you want to transition later. \n\nThe risk with tech roles is simply are you good enough? You can bullshit your way via the PM/PO route or by leaning on and \"collaborating\" with others, but with technical roles you need to really walk the walk.",

    "content": "I believe it should be dead simple for data scientists, analysts, and researchers to scale their code in the cloud without relying on DevOps. At my last company, whenever the data team needed to scale workloads, we handed it off to DevOps. They wired it up in Airflow DAGs, managed the infrastructure, and quickly became the bottleneck. When they tried teaching the entire data team how to deploy DAGs, it fell apart and we ended up back to queuing work for DevOps.\n\nThat experience pushed me to build cluster compute software that makes scaling dead simple for any Python developer. With a single function you can deploy to massive clusters (10k vCPUs, 1k GPUs). You can bring your own Docker image, define hardware requirements, run jobs as background tasks you can fire and forget, and kick off a million simple functions in seconds.\n\nIt’s [open source](https://github.com/Burla-Cloud/burla) and I’m still making install easier, but I also have a few managed versions.\n\nRight now I’m looking for test users running embarrassingly parallel workloads like data prep, hyperparameter tuning, batch inference, or Monte Carlo simulations. If you’re interested, email me at [**joe@burla.dev**]() and I’ll set you up with a managed cluster that includes 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours.\n\nHere’s an example of it in action: I spun up 4k vCPUs to screenshot 30k arXiv PDFs and push them to GCS in just a couple minutes: [https://x.com/infra\\_scale\\_5/status/1938024103744835961](https://x.com/infra_scale_5/status/1938024103744835961?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nWould love testers.",

    "content": "As the title says, I made it to the 3rd round interview for a Staff DS role. Thought I was doing well, but I bombed the coding portion, I only managed to outline my approach instead of producing actual code. That’s on me, mostly because I’ve gotten used to relying on GPT to crank out code for me over the last two years. Most of what I do is build POCs, check hypotheses, then have GPT generate small snippets that I review for logic before applying it. I honestly haven’t done “live coding” in a while.\n\nBefore the interview, I prepped with DataLemur for the pandas related questions and brushed up on building simple NNs and GNNs from scratch to cover the conceptual/simple DS side. A little bit on the transformer module as well to have my bases cover if they ask for it. I didn’t expect a LeetCode-style live coding question. I ended up pseudo-coding it, then stumbling hard when I tried to actually implement it.\n\nGot the rejection email today. Super heartbreaking to see. Do I go back to live-coding and memorizing syntax and practicing leetcodes for upcoming future DS interview?",

        "body": "From the article: More than 85 climate scientists declared the Department of Energy’s new climate report unfit for policymaking in a comprehensive review released Tuesday. The DOE’s report cherry-picked evidence, lacked peer-reviewed studies to support its questioning of the detrimental effects of climate change in the US and is “fundamentally incorrect,” the authors concluded.\n\nScientists have accurately modeled and predicted the volume and impact of excess CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere since the 1970s, when Exxon workers first began measuring the impacts of their product on the planet’s atmosphere. Since then, climate science has matured into a crucial tool to help humans gauge how a warming planet may affect everything from weather and crops to the economy and mental health.\n\n“This report makes a mockery of science. It relies on ideas that were rejected long ago, supported by misrepresentations of the body of scientific knowledge, omissions of important facts, arm waving, anecdotes, and confirmation bias,” said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, in a statement accompanying the review.\n\n“This report makes it clear DOE has no interest in engaging with the scientific community.”\n\nA DOE spokesperson said in an email that the report was prepared as part of the Trump administration’s effort to engage “in a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy. This report was reviewed internally by DOE scientific researchers and policy experts from the Office of Science and National Labs. The report is open to wider peer review from the scientific community and general public via the public comment period.”\n\nU.S. government scientists have for decades contributed to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, considered by many to be the Earth’s preeminent collection of climate science. The process and timeline the DOE followed in creating the new report before releasing it in July is unknown, and there do not appear to have been any public meetings associated with its drafting process. The document was internally peer reviewed “amongst DOE’s scientific research community,” the agency said in a statement accompanying the report’s release.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for scientists to disagree, many of the review’s authors feel what the DOE produced isn’t science at all. “Trying to circumvent, bypass, undermine decades of the government’s own work with the nation’s top scientists to generate definitive information about climate science to use in policymaking—that’s what’s different here,” said Kim Cobb, a professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Brown University and director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. Cobb co-authored two sections of the review.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump’s second administration, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced that it is reconsidering the 2009 endangerment finding that allows the agency to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In its proposal to rescind the finding, the EPA cited the DOE’s climate report as one of many that led the agency to develop “serious concerns” with how the U.S. regulates greenhouse gases.\n\n“It’s really important that we stand up for the integrity of [climate science] when it matters the most,” Cobb said. “And this may very well be when it mattered the most.”\n\nRoger Pielke Jr., a science policy analyst and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, who is cited in the DOE report, doesn’t believe the push to overturn the endangerment finding will come down to that report. In his view, the administration’s arguments are mostly legal, not scientific. “I think that given the composition of the Supreme Court, the endangerment finding might be in danger. But it’s not going to be because of the science,” he said.\n\nBut as more communities grapple with the fallout of hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other natural disasters exacerbated by climate change, Cobb fears the federal government is turning away from the best tool it has to help people across the U.S. adapt to a warming planet.\n\n“Science is a tool for prosperity and safety,” she said. “And when you turn your back on it in general—it’s not just going to be climate science, it’s going to be many other aspects of science and technology that are going to be forsaken—that will have grave costs.”",

Parts of the proposal were previously reported by the Financial Times.\n\n“Gaza can transform into a Mediterranean hub for manufacturing, trade, data, and tourism, benefiting from its strategic location, access to markets … resources and a young workforce all supported by Israeli tech and \\[Gulf Cooperation Council\\] investments,” the prospectus states.\n\nThe GREAT Trust was drafted by some of the same Israelis behind the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose aid distribution points in Gaza have been the sites of alleged massacres and other incidents in which thousands of aid-seeking Palestinians have been killed or wounded.\n\n\n\n\nThe GREAT Trust allocates US$6 billion ($A9.2 billion) for temporary housing for Palestinians who remain in Gaza and US$5 billion ($A7.6 billion) for those who relocate.",

    "title": "Launch HN: Risely (YC S25) – AI Agents for Universities",
    "content": "Hi HN, I’m Danial, co-founder and CTO of Risely AI (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;risely.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;risely.ai</a>). We&#x27;re building AI agents that automate operational workflows inside universities. Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d7a14400434144c490249d665a0d0499?sid=8d36736e-6c87-43d3-992d-203c6edb0cf9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d7a14400434144c490249d665a0d0499?...</a>.<p>Higher ed is full of inefficiencies. Every department runs on outdated systems that don’t talk to each other. Today, advising staff are looking up enrollment data in PeopleSoft or Ellucian, checking grades and assignments in Canvas, and trying to track engagement in a CRM, if they even have one. Often, it’s just spreadsheets and email. One advisor told us they were losing 8+ hours&#x2F;week just trying to answer: “Which students are struggling?”. During that lag, students slip through the cracks, and every lost student costs a school tuition.<p>I’ve spent the last decade building large-scale systems, but about a year ago, I left my job to build something personal. My time at UC Berkeley reinforced what my parents taught me when we immigrated to the U.S. - that education is the most powerful tool for upward mobility. But nearly 40% of students never graduate. Many of these students are capable and just need support, but the systems meant to support them are overwhelmed and broken.<p>So we built Risely. Our first agent focuses on academic advising and retention. It connects to a school’s systems, unifies the data, flags at-risk students, drafts outreach, and answers natural-language questions about caseloads and course progress. It gives staff leverage and time back, while helping more students stay on track.<p>The harder part is everything under the hood:\n- Connecting to archaic SIS, LMS, and CRM systems with inconsistent APIs and data models\n- Normalizing messy institutional data into something agents can reason over \n- Handling real policy constraints around FERPA, isolating tenant data, and meeting strict security and privacy standards for student PII \n- Designing agent workflows that are traceable, reviewable, and safe to run in production \n- Building infrastructure that can adapt to different institutional rules, processes, and edge cases.<p>We started with advising because retention ties directly to both revenue and student success. But the same foundation applies to registrar, admissions, financial aid, research administration, and other critical functions. As more agents come online, they can begin to coordinate with each other and hopefully improve the entire operations of a college or university.<p>If you’ve built systems that had to reconcile messy data, inconsistent workflows, or policy constraints using LLMs, we’d love to hear how you approached it.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts about the above, and anything in this space!",
